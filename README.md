GDS Website - a Django app
==========================
To get this up and running, first optionally create a virtualenv using python2.7.

Then run `pip install -r req.txt` which should install Django.

To run the server, `cd` into the `project/` directory and run `python manage.py runserver`

The project structure consists of a single app named `main` which can be found at `project/main/` while the project configuration can be found under `project/project/`

There are some very good Django tutorials, take a look at those if confused.
